### Hello World CLI
This is the classic "Hello, World!" program implemented as a Command-Line Interface (CLI) using Python. It demonstrates how to accept user input from the terminal and display a personalized greeting.
```python
def main():
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to the Python CLI World")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# Enter your name: Hernando
# Hello, Hernando! Welcome to the Python CLI World
```

### Basic Calculator

Performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes user input for two numbers and the operation to perform.
```python
def calculator():
    print("Welcome to the Basic Calculator")
    num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
    operator = input("Enter operator (+, -, *, /): ")
    num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

    if operator == '+':
        result = num1 + num2
    elif operator == '-':
        result = num1 - num2
    elif operator == '*':
        result = num1 * num2
    elif operator == '/':
        if num2 == 0:
            print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
            return
        result = num1 / num2
    else:
        print("Invalid operator.")
        return

    print(f"Result: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    calculator()

"""
Welcome to the Basic Calculator
Enter first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter second number: 5
Result: 50.0
"""
```

## Leap Year Checker
Check whether a given year is a leap year or not. It uses basic conditional logic to evaluate leap year rules (divisible by 4, not divisible by 100 unless also divisible by 400).
```python
def is_leap_year(year):
    return (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0)

def main():
    print("Leap Year Checker")
    year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

    if is_leap_year(year):
        print(f" {year} is a leap year.")
    else:
        print(f" {year} is not a leap year.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
"""
Leap Year Checker
Enter a year: 2024
2024 is a leap year.
""".
```

### Number Guessing Game
The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. The program gives hints like "Too high" or "Too low" until the correct number is guessed.
```python
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0

    while True:
        try:
            guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))
            attempts += 1

            if guess < secret_number:
                print("Too low! Try again.")
            elif guess > secret_number:
                print("Too high! Try again.")
            else:
                print(f"üéâ Congratulations! You guessed it in {attempts} attempts.")
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    number_guessing_game()

"""

```

### Tip Calculator
Helps users calculate the tip amount based on their bill and chosen tip percentage. It also provides the total amount to be paid, including the tip.
```python
def tip_calculator():
    print("Tip Calculator")
    
    try:
        bill = float(input("Enter the total bill amount: $"))
        tip_percent = float(input("Enter tip percentage (e.g., 15 for 15%): "))
        people = int(input("How many people are splitting the bill? "))

        tip_amount = bill * (tip_percent / 100)
        total_amount = bill + tip_amount
        amount_per_person = total_amount / people

        print(f"\nüßæ Tip: ${tip_amount:.2f}")
        print(f"Total Amount: ${total_amount:.2f}")
        print(f"Amount per person: ${amount_per_person:.2f}")
        
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.")

if __name__ == "__main__":

```

### Temperature Converter
Convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The user chooses the conversion direction and provides the temperature to convert.
```python
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(c):
    return (c * 9/5) + 32

def fahrenheit_to_celsius(f):
    return (f - 32) * 5/9

def temperature_converter():
    print("Temperature Converter")
    print("1. Celsius to Fahrenheit")
    print("2. Fahrenheit to Celsius")

    choice = input("Choose an option (1 or 2): ")

    try:
        if choice == '1':
            c = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))
            f = celsius_to_fahrenheit(c)
            print(f"{c}¬∞C = {f:.2f}¬∞F")

```

### Age Calculator
Calculates your current age based on your birth year. It uses the current system year to do the math.
```
from datetime import datetime

def age_calculator():
    print("Age Calculator")
    
    try:
        birth_year = int(input("Enter your birth year (e.g., 1998): "))
        current_year = datetime.now().year
        age = current_year - birth_year

        if age < 0:
            print("You entered a future year. Please check again.")
        else:
            print(f"You are {age} years old in {current_year}.")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid year.")

    age_calculator()

```

### Countdown Timer
The user inputs the number of seconds, and the timer counts down to zero with a 1-second interval, displaying the remaining time in the terminal.

```python
import time

def countdown_timer():
    print("‚è≥ Countdown Timer")

    try:
        seconds = int(input("Enter the countdown time in seconds: "))
        while seconds > 0:
            mins, secs = divmod(seconds, 60)
            timer = f"{mins:02d}:{secs:02d}"
            print(timer, end="\r")
            time.sleep(1)
            seconds -= 1

        print("‚è∞ Time's up!")
    except ValueError:

```

### BMI Calculator
Calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) using your weight and height. Based on the BMI value, it categorizes your health status (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese).
```
def calculate_bmi():
    print("‚öñÔ∏è BMI Calculator")

    try:
        weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kilograms (kg): "))
        height = float(input("Enter your height in meters (m): "))
        bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

        print(f"\nYour BMI is: {bmi:.2f}")

        if bmi < 18.5:
            print("üü° Category: Underweight")
        elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:
            print("üü¢ Category: Normal weight")
        elif 25 <= bmi < 30:
            print("üü† Category: Overweight")
        else:

### üé≤ Dice Roller
Simulates rolling a dice. Each time the user presses Enter, a new number between 1 and 6 is rolled, just like a real die!
```
import random

def roll_dice():
    print("üé≤ Dice Roller")
    while True:
        input("Press Enter to roll the dice...")
        dice = random.randint(1, 6)
        print(f"üéØ You rolled a {dice}!")
        
        again = input("Roll again? (y/n): ").lower()
        if again != 'y':
